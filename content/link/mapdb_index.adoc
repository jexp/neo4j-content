[INTRO]
Neo4j 2.0 introduced the concept of real automatic indexes with a new underlying indexing subsystem SPI. So I thought it would be really helpful to try it out and provide a faster indexing implementation than the default lucene one. I chose http://www.mapdb.org/[MapDB] for it and the results are https://github.com/jexp/neo4j-mapdb-index[here on github].
