[INTRO]
The Neo4j JDBC driver allows to access Neo4j server, embedded and in-memory databases via the JDBC API using Cypher. It also supports the http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/milestone/rest-api-transactional.html[transactional HTTP endpoint of Neo4j 2.0]. It was initially created by http://rickardoberg.wordpress.com/2011/12/19/creating-a-jdbc-driver-for-neo4j/[Rickard Ã–berg] and then continued to be developed by the Neo4j Community. The driver is available on https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-jdbc#neo4j-jdbc-driver[GitHub].
