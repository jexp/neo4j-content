:graph: type=article,title=A Graph contains Nodes and Relationships,introText=A Graph –[:RECORDS_DATA_IN]–> Nodes –[:WHICH_HAVE]–> Properties.,src=http://assets.neo4j.org/img/propertygraph/graphdb-gve.png,content=The simplest possible graph is a single Node, a record that has named values referred to as Properties. A Node could start with a single Property and grow to a few million, though that can get a little awkward. At some point it makes sense to distribute the data into multiple nodes, organized with explicit Relationships.
:graphdb_traversal: type=article,title=Query a Graph with a Traversal,introText=A Traversal –navigates–> a Graph; it –identifies–> Paths –which order–> Nodes.,src=http://assets.neo4j.org/img/propertygraph/graphdb-traverse.png,content=A Traversal is how you query a Graph, navigating from starting Nodes to related Nodes according to an algorithm, finding answers to questions like “what music do my friends like that I don’t yet own,” or “if this power supply goes down, what web services are affected?”
:graphdb_indexes: type=article,title=Indexes Look-up Nodes or Relationships,introText=An Index –maps from–> Properties –to either–> Nodes or Relationships. It –is a special–> Traversal.,src=http://assets.neo4j.org/img/propertygraph/graphdb-index.png,content=Often, you want to find a specific Node or Relationship according to a Property it has. This special case of Traversal is so common that it is optimized into an Index look-up, for questions like “find the Account for username master-of-graphs.”
