Neo4j is an open-source link:/learn/graphdatabase[graph database] supported by http://neotechnology.com/[Neo Technology].
 
Neo4j stores data in nodes connected by directed, typed relationships with properties on both, also known as a link:/learn/graphdatabase[Property Graph].
 
==== Main features

 
* _intuitive_, using a graph model for data representation</li> 
* _reliable_, with full ACID transactions</li> 
* _durable and fast_, using a custom disk-based, native storage engine</li> 
* _massively scalable_, up to several billion nodes/relationships/properties</li> 
* _highly-available_, when distributed across multiple machines</li> 
* _expressive_, with a powerful, human readable link:/learn/cypher[graph query language]</li> 
* _fast_, with a powerful traversal framework for high-speed graph queries</li> 
* _embeddable_, with a few small jars</li> 
* _simple_, accessible by a convenient http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/milestone/rest-api.html[REST interface] or an object-oriented Java http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/milestone/javadocs/[API]</li>
