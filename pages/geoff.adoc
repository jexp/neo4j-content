[INTRO]
Geoff is a declarative notation for representing graph data within concise human-readable text, designed specifically with Neo4j in mind. The format has been built to allow independent subgraphs to be represented outside of a graph database environment in such a way that they may be stored, transmitted and imported easily and efficiently. The basic elements which make up the Geoff format - subgraphs, rules and descriptors - are well defined but there exist several container representations which serve different purposes; commonly, either delimited text or a form of JSON is used.
