[INTRO]
The core engine of Neo4j supports the link:/learn/graphdatabase[property graph model]. This model can easily be adapted to support the LinkedData http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework[RDF model], consisting of Triples.This turns Neo4j into a full triple store, or you can just import and use LinkedData resources from e.g. http://dbpedia.org/[DBPedia] and others.
