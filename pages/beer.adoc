[INTRO]
Beer is at the core of software development, a good part of Neo4j runs on it.
There is a high density of beer-loving geeks in the neo4j community. Below are some of the projects and resources that have been developed with or around Neo4j.
 <blockquote>A traditional relational database may tell you the average age of everyone in this pub, but a graph database will tell you who is most likely to buy you a beer. _Andreas Kollegger_</blockquote> 
Of course, we are sponsoring beer for the link:/participate/meetups[Neo4j Meetups], so drop by!
